# NYC's Citibike Exploration with Tableau
A classwork example in which  bike sharing data is visualized in Tableau

# Overview of Project
Citibike is a program offered by Citi Bank and Lyft ridesharing company in New York City as a low cost and environmentally friendly option to travel around the city. For approximately $4 a ride for customers or $16 a month for subscribers (plus extra fees), a Citibike user can ride classic and electric bikes around the city."My friend Kate and I" are interested in starting a similar bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa, so we will need to use Tableau to produce some beautiful visualizations to first show our investors and later our team of researchers, budget analysts, and advertisers.  

## Purpose
These visualizations will show data for New York City but will ideally present a good case for starting a bikesharing company in Des Moines. Creating a story will add a complete, meaningful, easy to read, and professional feel to the Citibike data, which will help our presentation to major stakeholders.
