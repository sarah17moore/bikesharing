# NYC's Citibike Exploration with Tableau
A classwork example in which  bike sharing data is visualized in Tableau

# Overview of Project
Citibike is a program offered by Citi Bank and Lyft ridesharing company in New York City as a low cost and environmentally friendly option to travel around the city. For approximately $4 a ride for customers or $16 a month for subscribers (plus extra fees), a Citibike user can ride classic and electric bikes around the city."My friend Kate and I" are interested in starting a similar bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa, so we will need to use Tableau to produce some beautiful visualizations to first show our investors and later our team of researchers, budget analysts, and advertisers.  

## Purpose
These visualizations will show data for New York City but will ideally present a good case for starting a bikesharing company in Des Moines. Creating a story will add a complete, meaningful, easy to read, and professional feel to the Citibike data, which will help our presentation to major stakeholders.

# Summary
Although New York City and Des Moines, Iowa are not identical cities, there are several takeaways we can declare from this project. Citibike has found success in NYC by offering bikes at a low cost and at several readily available access points in the city. Des Moines could see similar success if several points are considered:
* Citibikes are popular for users that are looking for a ride for less than an hour - this could help workers in Des Moines
* Citibike in NYC has loyal subscribers who use the service consistently and often
* Customers tend to use Citibikes for longer durations than subscribers
* In NYC, Citibikes are popular among males - but this trend may not be perfectly replicated in a smaller, safer city
* Males and females use Citibikes on the same days, suggesting stable and consistent community-wide need

*Checkout Times for All Users: 99% of the bikes are used for less than 1 hour at a time. While some bikes are used for longer than an hour, most Citibikes are only checked out for 20 minutes or less. This is one of the points in the Tableau story.*
